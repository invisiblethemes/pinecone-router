**things you can do!**

-   make a simple middleware system to turn x-render and x-views into pluggable middlewares!
-   -   in the source i added `//X-FEATURE ONLY` and `//X-FEATURE END` comments around blocks of code for a specific feature
        in order to show which parts can be removed for exmaplee to make smaller builds.

-   add tests, I don't know where to start tbh and I'll appreciate it :)
-   improve documentation.

**things to keep in mind:**

-   if you use VS Code or Codium, use Prettier extension and load the `.prettierrc` settigs file.
